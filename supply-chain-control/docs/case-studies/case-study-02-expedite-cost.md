# Case Study 02 — Expedite Spend Reduction + Lane Discipline

![Case 02](../images/case02.png)

## Situation
Inbound logistics costs rose due to frequent expedites (air/courier) driven by late commits, documentation issues, and inconsistent lane discipline.

## Goals
- Reduce expedite spend by **25%**
- Improve carrier on-time to **≥ 93%**
- Maintain Past Due $ within ±5% while stabilizing the pipeline

## Dashboard modules
- Expedite spend trend and mode share
- Pareto: top lanes/carriers driving expedite $
- Carrier on-time and delay reasons
- Supplier-level expedite rate (behavior signal)

## KPI impact (example)
- Expedite spend: **$920K/month → $660K/month** (−28%)
- Air/courier share: **41% → 29%**
- Carrier on-time: **89% → 94%**
- Past Due $: stable (≤ +3% variance)

## Actions
- Mode policy by criticality and lead time
- Lane SLAs and carrier scorecards
- ASN/documentation gating to reduce avoidable expedites
- “Expedite justification” rule: only Tier-A within shortage window

## Next step
Add cost-to-serve by supplier (freight + quality + rework) to prioritize corrective actions.
