# Case Study 04 — PPV + Quote Variance on Precision Machined Parts

![Case 04](../images/case04.png)

## Situation
Precision machined components showed creeping unit price increases across quarters. The organization needed a clear PPV lens to focus negotiations and isolate drivers.

## Goals
- Identify top PPV contributors by supplier/part
- Separate structural PPV from one-time quote events
- Build an exec-ready “quote variance + PPV” view

## Dashboard modules
- PPV waterfall by month/quarter
- Top 20 PPV parts (qty-weighted)
- Supplier price trend with annotations (ECO, drawing rev, tooling updates)
- Commodity heatmap (where inflation concentrates)

## KPI impact (example)
- Negotiated reductions on 7 parts: **$380K annualized**
- Quote variance reduced: **−22%** on rebids
- Identified standardization: **−10%** part variety in one family

## Actions
- Negotiation packets: volume, price history, performance (OTIF/holds), lane costs
- Dual-source candidates flagged where PPV + risk tier are both high

## Next step
Add should-cost assumptions and rollups (assembly/tool-level cost impact).
