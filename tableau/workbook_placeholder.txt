# Tableau Public Workbook Placeholder

Paste your Tableau Public dashboard link here once published.

Notes:
- Tableau Public is simplest with a flat extract: data/processed/fact_supply_chain_flat.csv
- Or connect directly to raw facts using Relationships (po_lines + shipments + optional snapshots).
